# Cloud Computing - CS 4843 - Spring 2022 - Final Project 

## [Group Project Repo](https://github.com/aguerrero232/pull-den)
This is the repo that we as a group used for the backend code. In the README of this repo, 
you will find the following deliverables:
+ the details of our project
+ a diagram of our architecture
+ the link to our project (running front end)
+ a section detailing our use of Big Query and Google Analytics (the services we didn't cover
  in class) and how we implemented them into our project
+ Our project video demo
+ a link to the front end repo

## My personal contributions to the project:
My role in this project was backend engineering. Of course, if you go to the group repo link
above, you can find my direct code contributions. I also contributed to the architecural design 
of the project and creating the deliverables for our final submission (architecture diagram,
video demo, etc).
